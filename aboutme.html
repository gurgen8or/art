				<p>Hello, my name is Gurgen Sargsyan. I am a free thinker, an artist, and a computer wiz. I like to go to the beach, take walks in parks, and hang out with my friends. I grew up in Los Angeles, and love the weather here. I also like to travel. My favorite foods are In-N-Out, Sushi, Pizza, Lasagna, Zankou Chicken, and Chinese. I like all types of music, but my most listened to genres are Hip-Hop and Electronic music. I am lucky to have a big family, of which I am the oldest.</p>
				<p>If you would like to find me, I am usually hidden deep within my garage dwelling. Otherwise, I am cycling on the bike path, hiking up Mullholland, or taking a joy ride around town.</p>
